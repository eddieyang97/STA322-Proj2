4 factors, full factorial: 2^4 = 16 possible treatment assignments
all low / 0, a, b, c, d, ab, ac, ad, bc, bc, abc, abd, acd, bcd, abcd
5 replicates for each assignment? assume there are interactions, otherwise use half factorial?

a: rotor length = 8.5cm (baseline 7.5cm)
b: leg length = 12.0cm (baseline 7.5cm)
c: leg width = 5.0cm (baseline 3.2cm)
d: paper clip on leg - need to control where we put the paper clip since leg lengths would change based on treatment - 1cm from the bottom? in the middle?
